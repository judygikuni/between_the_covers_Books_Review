            <p>I would give the book the titile "Smile Through the Storm" because what stood out to me the most was how
                humor was used as a way to survive. It is truely amazing how while reading this book you can feel both
                the deep pain and still find yourself laughing at the same time. His ability to turn suffering into
                laughter is what made the story so powerful and memorable for me. </p>

            <h1>A Conflict of Love and Control</h1>
            <p id="quote"><i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left" id="left-icon"></i> Abel wanted a traditional marriage
                with a traditional wife, but he never fell in love with
                subservient women. He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.
                <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right" id="right-icon"></i>
            </p>

            <p> This quote from Born a Crime reveals the confusion between love and ownership.

                Abel was attracted to Patrcia because of her strength, independence, and unique personality. But
                once he had her, he tried to subdue the very qualities that attracted him in the first place.</p>

            <p>I see this as a conflict of interest. Many men are attracted to women with principles and
                determination, yet at the same time, they want to possess them.

                Some of these men know exactly what they want but pretend to be someone else until they win her
                over. Often, it’s not even about love, it becomes a way to prove to themselves that they can conquer
                something difficult.

                Others believe they’re into brave, outspoken women until those qualities start to challenge
                traditional gender roles. Then, everything becomes about pride and ego. They start demanding respect
                that no one ever took from them in the first place.</p>

            <p>Sadly, many women only realize this after marriage, when asking for freedom feels too late.
                Possession gets mistaken for love. Controlling behaviour is excused as care. It begins when their
                opinions are ignored and slowly, they start losing the very parts of themselves that once stood out.

                Eventually, they’re made to believe they can’t take a single step without that person. They stay
                sometimes for the children, or because society frowns on divorced women. They don’t see what they’re
                sacrificing until their health or happiness is affected or until people start asking about the marks
                on their faces.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, Patrcia’s story is one of these. What she thought was love ended up costing her both
                safety and family. Real love isn’t about putting someone in a cage. It’s about giving them the space to
                fly, and still choosing to stay beside them.</p>
