            <p>This title fits in for the book as Trevor Noah tries to express his birth to be somewhat illegal.
                This <br> is seen from when he was born as the mother had to lie in the hospital and also she had to
                <br>give birth in a different place so that the baby, Trevor Noah, can be accepted in the society.
                <br>Additionally, in the book, Trevor Noah describes how he receives a lot of bullying especially
                <br>when they moved to Eden park where kids could not play with him just because he was
                <br>coloured. All this shows that his existence was outlawed and he was not supposed to exist <br>in
                a world that worked with either the black people, the white people and not anybody in <br>between.
                <br> <br>
                Amidst all this, Trevor Noah is unstoppable by will since his determination and also character
                <br>made him unstoppable in achieving what he wanted. Even in a society that was trying to <br>dim
                him, he stood in the midst of it all, learnt different languages and also tried too hard to <br>work
                as he was also navigating his highschool journey. Him lacking his place in the society <br>did not
                stop him from achieving the best and being the best in whatever she does.

            <p>This quote from Born a crime resonates with our today's society as this still exists in the
                <br>society. When Patricia says that, <em> “He only wants a woman who is free because his <br>dream is
                    to
                    put her in a cage”</em> go hand in hand with how men admire strong and <br>independent women and not
                until they are in a relationship with them that they try to try <br>controlling them so as to put
                their dreams in a cage. This shows that the very traits they <br>loved become a threat to their
                control.
                <br><br>
                Abel adored how Patricia was independent and strong but he could not handle it when his
                <br>independence and strength questioned his authority. This is a gender dynamic that is <br>seen
                even in society today. Womens strength and independence is always celebrated <br>until it seems not
                to go with the societal expectations like being submissive or <br>prioritizing career to family. In
                our today's society, especially through social media, most <br>men will praise a woman because she
                is independent and going above and beyond but <br>still behind the lights shame her and try to
                insinuate that they are too opinionated or <br>they are too ambitious to be loved. This shows that
                some people are still holding on to <br>outdated expectations while others are ready for equality.
                <br><br>
                Personally, I have seen women who have shrinked themselves so that they can fit in <br>relationships
                and also marriages. They end up hiding their success and their strength <br>so as to fit in. This
                just shows the misinterpretation of true love as love should not <br>require one to hide under a
                cage but should allow people to celebrate growth and <br>freedom. As a society, there is a need to
                redefine the meaning of strength and also <br>partnership. Relationships and marriage should be all
                about mutual respect, and we <br>should all not fall in love with people to contain them but as they
                are.
