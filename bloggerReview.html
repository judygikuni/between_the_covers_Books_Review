            <h1> REFLECTIVE BLOG</h1>
            <p>Abel is a good example of “You can’t have more than you can chew”. <br>
                He desires to not only have a traditional marriage but also a traditional wife.<br> 
                Ironically, he aims for a woman who is the complete opposite of this with the intention of making her be a traditional wife.<br> 
                Patricia on the other hand is like a free bird and defies the system placed to do what she pleases. </p>
                <p> Abel reflects most men in society today and their expectations when they get married and the kind of roles that they expect their wives to play.
                     In society today there is conflict in marriage expectations especially with the parties involved. 
                     Some people still believe and adhere to the traditional norm where the man is considered to be <br>
                     the head of the family while the woman is expected to be submissive to her husband without questioning. 
                     However, there are some people who are against this. <br>These differences bring about conflict in marriages due to the mismatch. </p>
                     <p>In modern society most women are educated and independent 
                        and their expectations on marriage differ with the traditional one. 
                        Most aspire to have partners that allow room for equality. 
                        Contrary to this, most men opt for such women with the intention of making them submissive.<br> 
                        Some men use marriage as a trap for women. For example, <br>
                        there are instances of marriage conflicts that come about due minor things like house chores. <br>
                        Some men get violent to the extent of brutally hitting their wives just because they did not perform 
                        a certain task or they did it in a way that the men don’t find to be right.<br>
                         In traditional marriages men dominated and this can’t be the case in today's world.<br> 
                         It is necessary to have a balance in marriages as men and women are both equal. </p><br>
                         <h2>BOOK RENAME</h2>
                         <h1>"TREVOR'S MIXED-LIFE"</h1>
                         <p>A title that I find fit for the "born a crime" book is "Trevor's mixed-life.<br>
                        The name mixed will explain him being born as a kid of two races.<br>
                        This can be used to not only describe him as a boy of color but also the diverse experiences that Trevor has which
                        are narrated in the book. For example his school life, love life, family life and many others.<br>
                        By using the words "mixed-life" it will help to depict the different experiences that Trevor had from his childhood to his prime years.
